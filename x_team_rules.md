# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
- Have people volunteer for various tasks that they would like to do/feel they are best suited to
- If this encounters difficulty have the team leader assign tasks to team members


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
- Post updated code often and check in with each other to ensure that there is consistency
- If anyone is falling behind on their section check in to see if they are stuck or just busy


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
- If someone is encountering an issue that they are having serious difficulties resolving they should attempt to get help from others in navigating the obstacle
- If a member feels that they will not be able to complete a task in the necessary time, they should request help from the rest of the group


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

- If a response is required on some group communication, trying to acheive no more than a 48 hour turn arround time
- Striving to complete assignments at least 1 day prior to the deadline to allow time for review and submission
- Assisting each other as needed when difficulties occur
